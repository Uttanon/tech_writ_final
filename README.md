## Writing the Introduction

- composed last in the writing process
- needs to capture the rationale behind the entire paper
- often the most difficult to write

### Moves in the introduction

- establishing a research territory
  - showing the general research area is important (optional)
  - introducing and reviewing items of previous research in the area (obligatory)
- establishing a niche
  - by indicating a gap in the previous research, or by extending previous knowledge in some way (obligatory)
- occupying the niche
  - by outlining the purposes or stating the nature of the present research (obligatory)

### Establishing a niche

Raising a question:

- It remains unclear whether ...
- It would thus be of interest to learn how ...

#### Extending Previous Knowledge

- These recent developments in computer-aided design clearly have considerable potential. In this paper, we demonstrate ...
- Such active-R networks eliminate the need for external passive reactance elements. This paper utilizes the active-R approach for the design of a circuit ...

#### Negative Openings

However, little (information/attention/work/data/research) ... \
However, few (studies/investigations/researchers/attempts) ...

Note that we should avoid using strong terms such as no, none.

## Materials and methods

- describes in sufficient detail in order that the experiment can be replicated
- materials and equipment
  - tools used in the experiment, include testing instruments, technical equipment, or materials
- procedures
  - what you did in the course of the study, how the data were collected and with what instruments, and the order of the steps

### Writing units and numbers

- abbreviate a unit when used with figures. otherwise write it as a word
- NO period after scientific abbreviations, but use a period with non-technical abbreviations, e.g. 100 mg
- space between the number and unit, e.g. 203.65 m
- number before the unit, except for pH
- use the same abbreviation for singular and plural
